# LeapSD
Kicad project files for the LeapSD adapter board for Leapfrog devices.

This is entirely untested, but its based on existing designs and should work.

I tested the design by literally hardwiring an sd card slot into my gs following the same schematic.

There could still be board errors as this is my first board design (unless you count drawing a schematic on notebook paper and testing on perfboard)

I used as few surface mount parts as possible to make assembly easier.
