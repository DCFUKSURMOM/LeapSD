# LeapSD
Kicad project files for the LeapSD adapter board for Leapfrog devices.

The board had been confirmed working by Th3KillinJok3

I tested the design by literally hardwiring an SD card slot into my Leapster GS following the same schematic.

This was my first proper board design (unless you count drawing a schematic on notebook paper and testing on perfboard)

I used as few surface mount parts as possible to make assembly easier.
